**Subject: Why I built SmartFlow (and why it uses Charlie Munger's brain) 🧠**

Hi Product Hunt! 👋

I'm the maker of SmartFlow.

We all feel it – the **AI FOMO**. Every day, ground-breaking tools and papers are released, but keeping up feels like a full-time job. And if English isn't your first language, the friction is doubled.

I built SmartFlow to solve my own information anxiety. I didn't just want "news"; I wanted **signals**.

**What makes SmartFlow different?**
1.  **Mental Models Analysis**: It doesn't just summarize; it uses **Charlie Munger's mental models** (e.g., Opportunity Cost, Inversion, Entropy) to analyze *why* a piece of news matters and *what* you should do about it.
2.  **Strict Bilingual Sync**: Browse in English or Traditional Chinese with **zero latency**. No broken layouts, no waiting.
3.  **Audio Mode**: Listen to your daily feed like a personalized podcast while commuting.

**Yes, it is Open Source!** 🔓
I believe knowledge tools should be transparent. You can check out how we built the scraping and analysis engine on our GitHub (link on the page).

I’ll be hanging out here all day answering questions.

**I’d love to hear your feedback: Which "Mental Model" would you like our AI to learn next?**

Cheers! 🚀
